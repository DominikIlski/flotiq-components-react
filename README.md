# Flotiq components for React

This project uses eslint. This project do not have React app to start, it only has storybook part.
The build storybook is available on [https://flotiq.github.io/flotiq-components-react/](https://flotiq.github.io/flotiq-components-react)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

To install all dependencies. Please DO NOT use npm for that.

### `yarn storybook`

To start storybook server. It will be available on [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)

### `yarn compile`

To compile components into dist directory and prepare them for publish on npm registry.

### `npm publish`

To publish package on npm registry.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
